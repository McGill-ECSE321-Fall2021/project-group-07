# Project Management and Report


**DELIVERABLE 1**

Our team decided to focus most of our attention on the design of our project, to avoid having to modify it further down the line when our project is more developed and the design is further embedded. Our goals were to finalize a UML class diagram, Use-Case diagrams and requirements that were satisfactory and took into account future deliverables. We limited ourselves to 3 group meetings and outside of these meetings, we divided the tasks and worked individually. Together, we made the main flow use-case, the UML class diagram, and discussed requirements. We discussed requirements using GitHub issues, and we split up the use-case scenarios, the model classes to persist, and the persistance layer tests.
